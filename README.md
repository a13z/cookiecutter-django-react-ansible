## Templating a Project

First, you'll need to make sure that you have cookiecutter installed:

```
$ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.6.0"
```

Next, run cookiecutter against this project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tmiller02/cookiecutter-django-react-ansible.git
$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-django-react-ansible
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Answer these prompts with your desired
options. Once you've provided these values, your project will be generated.

```
project_name [My Project]: My Project
project_slug [my_project]: my_project
frontend_app_dev_hostname [my-project.test]: my-project.vagrant
backend_app_dev_hostname [api.my-project.vagrant]: api.my-project.vagrant
database_dev_hostname [db.my-project.vagrant]: db.my-project.vagrant
provisioner_hostname [provisioner.my-project.vagrant]: provisioner.my-project.vagrant
# if you aren't using a proxy just leave these blank
vagrant_yum_proxy []: 
vagrant_http_proxy []: 
vagrant_https_proxy []:
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```
$ cd my_project/
$ ls
```

Create a git repo and push it there:

```
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<my-git-user>/<my-git-repo>.git
$ git push -u origin master
```
## Quickstart

To get up and running quickly, make sure you have the following requirements installed:
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

To provision the development environment, run:
```
$ cd my_project
$ vagrant up --provision
```
    
Once provisioning has finished, you can access the django app at the hostname you
set for the `backend_app_dev_hostname` option, e.g. https://api.my-project.vagrant.
You can access the react app at the hostname you set for the
`frontend_app_dev_hostname`, e.g. https://my-project.vagrant.

## Next Steps

Check out the documentation in `README.md` in your generated project for more
detailed instructions on getting started.
